# EmpoweredPixels
Is a game that I originally used to learn angular, but then became more.

It is accessible here:
https://empoweredpixels.dylf.de/

# Planned features
* Add skill selection
* Add account operations (delete, change password)
* Add map additions (zones: heal, burn, teleport)
* Update skill targetting (use actual projectiles, add support for area damage)
* Rework skills to display damage done, and applied conditions/healing
* Add alchemy (players cannot actively participate in this game, this would be a way to allow more participation without breaking the base concept)
  * Potions
  * Stun breakers
* Rework Combat log (use more icons, less text)
* Make fighterlogic scriptable (allow players to script their own fighter logic)
